		<p><u><b>What is Ajqvue?</b></u></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajqvue provides an easy to use Java based interface for viewing,
			adding, editing, or deleting entries in the Derby, H2, HSQL, Microsoft SQL,
			MSAccess, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases. All
			tables and fields are available for access in the selected database.<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajqvue is the result of a condensed version of a larger project
			that was needed to access an inventory database. The project from its
			inception was to be constructed from code that could be run on most
			OS, Operating Systems, platform independent. In addition the selected
			database, MySQL, was also deemed to be chosen because of its open source
			nature. The final key was network enabled. The application would need to
			be able to connect to the database either locally, same machine, or a
			server anywhere that was Internet accessable. Java and MySQL fit these
			needs.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ajqvue has expanded beyond the scope of MySQL and now supports
			alternate databases and plugins. The application only needs two other
			pieces of code, the JRE, Java Runtime Environment, and a JDBC, Java Database
			Connectivity, driver. The JDBC provides the driver interface between the
			Java SQL, structured query language, statements, and the database. As of
			the release of this version of Ajqvue the application has been tested
			with the Apache Derby, H2, HSQL, MS SQL, MSAccess, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL,
			and SQLite databases. The application once installed can provide a much quicker
			access/update to a database than a web based interface frontend and Ajqvue
			supports transaction locking. If your small business, scientific community,
			government agency, or educational institute wants to quickly access one of
			the supported databases for viewing, adding, editing, searching, and analyzing
			data Ajqvue provides an alternative that is simple and easy to use.<br><br>

		<u><b>Installation Notes:<br></b></u>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajqvue is a stand alone application. To get started
			download and unzip the release file to your local hard drive using a program
			such as WinZip, 7-Zip, Tar or similar compression/decompression program.
			Extract the Ajqvue files to the desired location on the hard disk. On a
			Windows system this may be any location, but on a Unix or Linux system it will
			be in the home directory of the user. If multiple users are to access
			the application then consult with the system administrator of your
			workstation. The likely location will be in the /usr/local or a public
			directory, which all users have access to for application execution.<br><br>
		</p>
		<u><b>Update Notes:<br></b></u>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajqvue updates need no special attention. Just install the latest
			release into your existing directory. The only other major concern of a new
			release that might be of interest is obtaining new connection parameters.
			Each new release that supports a additional database will have an example
			configuration for the connection parameters in the advanced login parameters.
			Likely changes will be included in the reference ajqvue.xml file located
			in the installation directory. Often the Driver, Protocol, SubProtocol, and
			Port parameters will be different for the various database servers. To gain
			access to any new connection parameters one may just open the reference
			ajqvue.xml file and copy and paste any additional entries desired into
			your own working copy of the ajqvue.xml file. See the General Setup
			Instructions below for locating this file.
			
		</p>
		<p><font size="+1"><strong>General Setup Instructions</strong></font><br></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ajqvue application is a Java based program and does
			require the JRE, to be installed. The minimum runtime environment needs to be
			JRE-1.7. In addition to the JRE an extension, JDBC, needs to be installed that
			allows Java to communicate to the database. The programs are available on the
			Internet free of charge. Check with the sites
			<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/" target="_blank">MS SQL</a>,
			<a href="http://www.mariadb.org" target="_blank">mariadb.org</a>,
			<a href="http://dev.mysql.com" target="_blank">dev.mysql.com</a>,
			<a href="http://oracle.com" target="_blank">oracle.com</a>,
			<a href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org" target="_blank">jdbc.postgresql.org</a>, and
			the jar file for these extensions needs to be installed to the JRE /lib/ext
			directory. On a Windows system this JRE directory in normally under C:/Windows/java.
			On a Linux/Unix system the directory is normally under the /usr/lib directory,
			and is most easily found by typing the command "which java" in a console.
			Please consult with each vendor for specific installation instructions for these
			JDBC pieces of code. Similarly if other databases are to be accessed via the
			application then again installed the recommended driver(s) to the Java Runtime
			/lib/ext directory. The exceptions to JDBC installations are for the Derby, H2,
			HSQL, and SQLite databases. Derby requires the derby.jar, derbynet.jar, and derbyclient.jar
			files to placed in the Java Extension directory. H2, and HSQL use an integrated JDBC
			built into the application. Ajqvue includes these databases so no additional
			installation need take place. Likewise the SQLite JDBC need also not be installed
			as it is a included library along with native libaries for the SQLite database.<br><br>
			
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new login interface and Connection Manager use
			a XML configuration file for saving user preferences. Upon first running
			Ajqvue a reference XML file, ajqvue.xml, located in the installation
			directory is read then copied to the users home directory under a newly created
			directory, .ajqvue. <b>DO NOT MODIFY THIS REFERENCE FILE!</b> The newly
			created directory On Windows &reg; 98 will be 'C:Windows\.ajqvue'. On
			Windows &reg; XP, Vista, and Windows 7 the new directory will be in the user's
			home folder. On a Linux system the new directory will be '/home/user/.ajqvue'.
			All saved changes performed in site management will be stored in the XML file located
			in the above referenced directory. The user is encouraged to make a backup of this
			file occasionally. The Ajqvue application also supports internationalization.
			The .ajqvue directory in addition to retaining the XML configuration file
			will also house the file ajqvue_locale.txt which holds the entry that allows
			control of language support.<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajqvue requires a database to be setup to communicate with
			in order to work. It is beyond the scope of this document for installing and setting
			up a database, but remember you must have user rights to the database tables
			you are trying to access. Please consult with your database system administrator
			for proper grant rights.

		<p> <strong><font size="+1">Adding a Shortcut</font></strong><br></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add a Ajqvue icon to your desktop, right click the mouse pointer on an unused
			area of your desktop to display the pop up menu and select <strong>New&nbsp;|&nbsp;Shortcut</strong>. Choose
			<strong>Browse</strong>, find and double click on Ajqvue.jar, then click on <strong>Next</strong>.
			Type in "Ajqvue" for the name of the shortcut, then click <strong>Finish</strong>. To run
			Ajqvue, either double click on the new Ajqvue icon or use the <strong>Start&nbsp;|&nbsp;Run</strong>
			command.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a Unix or Linux system a shortcut may be created in the KDE Desktop environment
			by right clicking on the desktop and selecting <strong>Create New | File | Link to Application.</strong>
			Give the application a name such as "Ajqvue" in the General tab. Next select the Application tab
			and fill in the description desired then browse to the location on the disk where Ajqvue was installed
			and select the Ajqvue.jar file for the Command entry. The Command entry is still not complete and must
			contain the Java command. Place before the quoted Ajqvue.jar entry, "java -jar ". Do not place quotes
			of any kind around this command, the quotes only contain the Jar file location. Example: java -jar 
			'/home/~user/Ajqvue/Ajqvue.jar'. Finally select the Work Path as the directory where installation
			took place.<br><br>
			
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ajqvue application may also be run directly from a command/console window by typing in the command
			"java -jar Ajqvue.jar" while in the installation directory. A Linux/Unix environment will require the
			file location to be specified by "./Ajqvue.jar", remember this must be done with a console that is running
			within a X Window environment like KDE or Gnome.
