Ajqvue Version 2.0 Released

The Ajqvue project is pleased to release v2.0 to the public. The release
is a major maintenance, cleanup, and consolidation of the code base. In
part most of the work was driven by a DB_to_FileMemoryDB plugin and insuring
a more robust handling of SQLite affinity. The sqlite-jdbc library has again
been included with the application. All libraries have been updated. The
plugin DataCharts included with Ajqvue has been updated with JFreeChart,
1.5.0.

Ajqvue provides an easy to use Java based user interface front-end
for viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to visually build queries, profile and
plot data for analysis.
